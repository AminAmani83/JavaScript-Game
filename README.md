# JavaScript-Game
Final Project (JS Course @ John Abbott)

Graphics.html & Graphics.js
Are used for practicing different ways to play with Canvas:

- The Canvas is 600 x 600 px.
- The SpaceCraft and SpaceInvader pictures are each 60 x 60 px.
- The game takes place on a 10 x 10 grid, and if you want to move one of the spacecrafts, you can add 60 to its X or Y coordinate.

Game.html & Game.js
are used for the real game.
